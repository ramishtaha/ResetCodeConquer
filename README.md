## Repository Structure

- **LearningLogs/**  
  Markdown files (e.g., `Week1.md`, `Week2.md`, etc.) that capture insights, summaries, and reflections of what I learn on a weekly basis.

- **Projects/**  
  Individual project folders containing source code, a project-specific `README.md`, and any assets or demos. Each project showcases applied skills and the challenges tackled.

- **Challenges/**  
  Solutions and write-ups for coding challenges and algorithmic problems from platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank, highlighting my problem-solving process.
